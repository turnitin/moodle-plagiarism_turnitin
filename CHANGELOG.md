#### Report scores should now update as expected

An issue was raised requiring instructors to use the ‘refresh all submissions' button in the Plagiarism Plugin assignment settings, in order to see the Turnitin Similarity score. This has now been resolved and users no longer need to select the 'refresh all submissions’ button to see the Turnitin Similarity score appear in the Moodle assignment inbox when using the task Send Queued Files from the Turnitin Plagiarism Plugin.

#### Core Moodle PhpUnit Test now functioning as expected

A core PhpUnit test was failing due to extra minified JS files. These files have now been removed and the test should no longer fail.
This improvement was submitted as a pull request by @petersistrom on Github. Thanks, Peter!

### Release:	v2023033001

#### Students that have previously rejected the EULA can now resubmit

We have fixed an issue that was preventing students from being able to resubmit to Turnitin for an assignment where they had previously rejected the EULA. Now if a student accepts the EULA, they will be able to successfully resubmit to any assignments where they previously rejected the EULA.

#### Inbox now displays the highest score when Translated Matching is enabled

We have fixed an issue with the similarity score value in the Moodle Plagiarism Plugin inbox. Previously it wasn't updating with the highest score when Translated Matching was enabled, and instead the inbox continued to display the first score, even if it was the lower of the two.

#### Duplicate quiz responses are now handled separately

We have fixed an issue where if a student submitted the same response multiple times on a quiz, all duplicate responses would be linked to the same report, which would not allow them to be reviewed by an instructor as separate responses. Each response now generates a separate report.

#### We’ve fixed an issue that resulted in overwritten grades

Previously, selecting the blue pencil icon to launch a Turnitin assignment from the Moodle assignment would override any grades provided in Moodle. This has now been resolved and grades provided in Moodle will be retained unless a grade is provided in the Turnitin report.

#### We have made improvements to the Rubric manager sizing

Previously, the Rubric manager was sized incorrectly when launched in Moodle 3.11. This issue has now been resolved.

#### We have made improvements to Moodle Quiz handling

An additional check has been added to determine whether Turnitin is enabled on a Moodle Quiz resulting in performance improvements.

#### :zap: What's new

We’ve had several community members actively contribute towards making the Moodle plagiarism plugin the best it can be, with some insightful and much appreciated pull requests. Check out all the latest improvements, with special thanks to our community members who have contributed towards them.

#### Moodle Quizzes will perform better when many users take a quiz that involves essay-based questions

When viewing a Moodle Quiz results, Turnitin would request the CMID (Course Module ID) multiple times, even after it had already been provided. This could cause classes to see performance issues when a larger class used essay-based questions as a part of their Moodle Quiz. This enhancement fixes the issue and users should expect to see increased performance when using Moodle Quizzes with larger classes now.

With special thanks to [@aolley](https://github.com/aolley) for this contribution.

#### Performance improvements when Turnitin isn’t enabled for a Moodle activity

When Turnitin wasn’t enabled for a Moodle activity, multiple database calls would still be run for each user within the activity, resulting is a lot of unnecessary extra database load. This change removes these checks when Turnitin is not enabled. Users should expect to see some performance enhancements, particularly in larger classes.

With special thanks to [@danmarsden](https://github.com/danmarsden) for this contribution.

#### Database schema is now consistent when upgrading to a new version of the plugin

This change fixes an issue where there was an alignment issue between the install and upgrade scripts, resulting in multiple is mismatches.

With special thanks to [@golenkovm](https://github.com/golenkovm) and [@TomoTsuyuki](https://github.com/TomoTsuyuki) for the fix, and kristian-94 for their thorough initial investigation.

#### Messages sent by Turnitin to instructors and students now apply the Moodle filters

Filters can be used in Moodle to convert or change a message into a richer form of media. This includes creating links, converting mathematical formula into images, and even showing multiple languages at once on screen.

Any messages sent by Turnitin will now work with these filters.

With special thanks to [@izendegi](https://github.com/izendegi) for this contribution.

#### Turnitin EULA prompt will now show at all times when using Moodle Forums

When using a Moodle Forum, making an reply on the same page would not show the prompt to accept the Turnitin EULA for processing. The prompt would still be shown the first time the page is loaded. Users can now expect to see the EULA prompt on each interaction they would do in a forum that would potentially generate a Similarity Report if the EULA was accepted.

With special thanks to [@jonof](https://github.com/jonof) for this contribution.

#### Quiz attempt grades will set correct after opening the Similarity Report

Opening the Similarity Report in a quiz attempt could in some situations alter the calculated grade for a student. User can expect for the Similarity Report to no longer affect the calculated grade.

With special thanks again to [@jonof](https://github.com/jonof) for their contribution.

### Date:       2021-September-15
### Release:	2021091501

#### :wrench: Fixes and enhancements

#### Empty grades in Turnitin will not override Moodle grading

When you had completed grading in Moodle and someone opened the Turnitin viewer for the submission, if no grade had been set in Turnitin, the Moodle grade would be lost. Now, the grade within Moodle will be retained and an ungraded Turnitin viewer can be opened without it causing any problems.

Note: If a grade is removed from Turnitin, it will no longer remove it from Moodle as the viewer will then be ‘empty’ and we assume that the Moodle grade is intended.

#### Only the essay type question in a Moodle Quiz will request a Similarity Report 

We’ve refined this feature to only request a Similarity Report for Essay type questions. Turnitin would only ever create a report for these types of questions anyway, but a request was sent for all question types. This could cause bigger classes to become sluggish. You should notice that bigger classes that use a lot of quizzes are much easier to navigate now.

Thanks to Dan Marsden And Alex Morris for highlighting and providing a fix for this.

#### Test connection now will check the connection to Turnitin at all times

Previously, Test Connection wouldn’t work until the plugin was configured. This could potentially cause confusion with users assuming that as no error had been shown the connection must already be established. We’ve changed it so that the Test Connection feature will always look to see if a successful connection has been made when checking.

#### Support for Moodle 3.11

#### Use Turnitin with Moodle Quizzes
We can now check for similarity on any files that are uploaded as a part of a Moodle quiz.

#### Cron tasks will no longer run when Moodle is not configured
Thanks to alexmorrisnz for the pull request!

#### Removed grades change the grade in Moodle
When a grade is removed from Turnitin, this removal will also be reflected within Moodle as the submission being ungraded.

#### Turnitin classes will now be expired along with a Moodle course
We will now sync dates in Moodle with the Turnitin database. When the Moodle course expires, we will close out those classes in Turnitin. This will free up the active student count for those classes.

#### Create or access Moodle assignments, forums, and workshops when Turnitin is disabled
If Turnitin is disabled for an assignment, forum, or workshop and Turnitin is unavailable by having the wrong configuration options or being under maintenance, then an error message would be shown. This bug has been fixed, and Turnitin being unreachable will no longer impact your ability to create or access your content.

#### Changes to the Moodle course name will be reflected everywhere
When a Moodle course title is changed, this will now be updated in Turnitin too. This will include the digital receipts students receive when they submit their paper.

#### Use Turnitin in a Moodle Quiz

Turnitin will be usable as a part of a Moodle quiz when Moodle releases the feature. When enabled for your account, simply add an essay question as one of the quiz questions. A similarity report will be generated when the student submits the quiz. Track this release on the Moodle Tracker https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32226).

---

#### :wrench: Fixes and enhancements

#### Improved support for large class sizes

When closing the Turnitin viewer, we’d refresh the page so any updates you applied to the assignment would be reflected in Moodle. However, this refresh caused unnecessary load when a class was particularly large. When we identify increased latency like this, we’ll deactivate automatic refreshes of the inbox and prompt you to refresh the inbox manually after grading.

#### View shared rubrics when creating a Moodle assignment

When creating a Moodle assignment it is possible to view all of your Turnitin Rubrics and attach one to a class from its creation. However, a bug had prevented any rubrics that had been shared with you from appearing in this list. You’ll now find them there and ready to be added to any future assignments you create. This fixes a known issue.

#### General accessibility improvements

We’ve made a few accessibility improvements to help ensure that all Turnitin users can use the plugin with the same high-quality experience. These include:

- Made more elements accessible via tab navigation
- You can launch the Turnitin viewer now by using the enter key on the appropriate element. 
- Tools tips are available for various settings and readable by a screen reader or via keyboard navigation.
- General improvements to the plugin configuration screen ensuring unique ARIA labels and logical tab order.

#### Anonymous marking is now available again

#### Submissions will still display when error code 13 is detected

Error code 13 can appear in various circumstances where a score is not returned to Turnitin. A bug caused submissions with this error code to no longer display in the inbox. While the error code can still occur, it will no longer prevent access to the submission and it will be displayed within the inbox as intended.

#### Moodle Plagiarism Plugin no longer dependant on Moodle V2

Previously, the Plagiarism Plugin was bundled along with Moodle Direct V2. Now, the Plagiarism Plugin is installed and configured separately. 
     
If you are upgrading from a previous version of the Plagiarism Plugin, your existing configuration will be migrated over from Moodle V2.

#### Forum messaging error resolved

When creating a forum post within Turnitin, we were showing information about report regeneration times when resubmitting. As information about resubmissions is not relevant to forum users, we’ve removed this notification from this view.

#### Improvements to plugin stability and modals

We’ve improved the stability of the plugin and made changes to our modals (dialog boxes) within Moodle. Modals will now be clearer and adapt to the browser theme that you’re using to improve the usability of the plugin.

#### Error code 13 will now only display when appropriate

In a previous release, we introduced ‘Error Code 13’. This error is shown when we’ve managed to upload to our servers but weren’t able to generate a similarity report at the time of submission. Since then, we’ve reconsidered how this error state should be handled. With this release, we will reset all instances of Error code 13. Going forward, we will only accept an upload if the plugin is able to connect to Turnitin and generate a similarity report.

#### Use Marking Workflows without errors

In a rare number of cases, it was possible when using Marking Workflows for students to receive an error message when they attempt to view their submissions after grades have been released. We’ve reworked how the grade release happens when using Marking Workflows so that students will no longer see this error.

#### Forum users can use Turnitin without seeing extraneous notifications

When creating a forum post with Turnitin available we were showing information about our report regeneration times when resubmitting to Turnitin. As information about resubmissions is not relevant to forum users, we’ve removed this notification from this view. 

#### Students can’t access the online grading view prematurely

When using our online grading functionality, it was possible for students to launch the viewer despite there being no grading having been completed. To help reduce confusion, this link will now be disabled for students until after the post-date has passed.

#### All files submitted to a multi-file assignment are now sent to Turnitin

We received a report from one of our users who noticed an emerging issue for assignments allowing multiple-file submissions: only one of the submitted files was sent to Turnitin, therefore only generating one Similarity Report. We've resolved this!

**Note:** This issue stemmed from the release of plugin version 2018062601.

#### Rubric and grading forms now successfully attach to Turnitin assignments

We apologize for any difficulty you may have encountered when trying to attach rubrics and grading forms to your assignments through the Moodle Plagiarism Plugin. We're very pleased to announce that normal service has resumed, and all rubric and grading form selections made during and after assignment creation will stick like glue!

#### We'll no longer attempt to process the Similarity Reports of deleted submissions

Having mistakenly attempted to retrieve the Similarity Reports of deleted submissions, as a direct result, our system recently encountered difficulties with processing new submissions. "It's time to let go of the past!" we told the system, which reluctantly agreed. We'll now no longer try to pull Similarity Reports for deleted submissions... hoorah!

#### Resubmissions now overwrite the previous submission

When a student made a resubmission to Turnitin, their previous submission wasn't removed from the assignment inbox; this led to confusion for instructors, who weren't too sure which submission was the most up-to-date version. We've made sure that resubmissions now overwrite the existing submission.

> **Known issue:** While we've been able to fix this issue for students, if an instructor resubmits on behalf of a student, multiple submissions may still appear in Turnitin. We're working on a fix for this and will update you as soon as we find one!

#### The Plagiarism Plugin now works on Moodle 3.1 and earlier versions

Users running Moodle version 3.1 or earlier encountered an unexpected error when submitting a file. The error message, referring to an invalid parameter, was the result of a change made in our previous release. We apologize for the trouble this may have caused and can confirm that Moodle version 3.1 and earlier now function correctly.

#### Turnitin's Plagiarism Plugin is GDPR compliant!

To support upcoming changes to European data protection law, we’ve focused our efforts on refreshing our processes around how we use your data.

##### Repository settings are more transparent

We've made the Moodle Plagiarism Plugin repository settings much clearer, by providing easy-to-understand, transparent language behind the Store student papers help icon. During assignment setup, administrators and instructors can now be completely sure that they're selecting the correct storage options for student papers.

##### We're reporting on the data we store about our users

Moodle has released two plugins with privacy features to assist with GDPR compliance. While we've successfully implemented [Moodle's new privacy features](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Privacy_API), Moodle's update is only available to those using Moodle 3.3.5+, 3.4.2+, or 3.5. Therefore, if you're using an earlier version, you must upgrade to have access to these new features.

To inform you about the data we store in relation to our users, we now provide a detailed list via the Moodle Privacy and Policies page. Learn more about the data we're reporting on via our [Moodle Plugins and GDPR](https://help.turnitin.com/feedback-studio/moodle/moodle-plugins-and-gdpr.htm) page.

#### Students can request to download their data

Students have the ability to request an export of their data stored in Moodle. This request can be accepted or declined by their Moodle administrator. If accepted, the student will be able to download all the data held about them, which includes data from Turnitin.

#### Students can request to remove their data

Students can also request their data to be removed from Moodle. This requested can be accepted or declined by their Moodle administrator. If accepted, the administrator will remove the student data from Moodle. However, administrators must contact support@turnitin.com to request that student data be removed from Turnitin itself.
  
> If you're a Moodle administrator, and using version 3.3.5+, 3.4.2+, or 3.5, follow the steps on the [Moodle Plugins and GDPR](https://help.turnitin.com/feedback-studio/moodle/moodle-plugins-and-gdpr.htm) page to view the data we store in Moodle.

#### You can now send all papers to your institutional repository by default!

We're aligning Turnitin repository options with the Plagiarism Plugin. If an institutional repository is enabled on their Turnitin account, administrators can now opt to **Submit all papers to the institutional repository**. This submission storage option sends all student submissions to the institutional repository without instructor intervention. For this repository option to work successfully, it must firstly be enabled in Turnitin, before it can be configured in Moodle.

If you're a Moodle administrator, follow the steps below to enable this repository setting in Turnitin:

1. Log into Turnitin.com or TurnitinUK.com.
2. Under **Edit**, select the cog  icon.
3. Select **Edit account settings**.
4. Scroll to **Paper repository options** and select **Submit all papers to the institution repository**.
6. Select the **Submit** button at the bottom of the page.

Now, it's time to move to Moodle!

1. From the Moodle left-hand side panel, select **Site administration**.
2. Select **Plugins**.
3. Select **Activity Modules**.
4. Then **Manage Activities**.
5. Scroll to **Turnitin Assignment 2** and select **Settings**.
6. Scroll to **Paper Repository Assignments** and select **Submit all papers to the institutional repository**.

#### We've removed a technical notice from the assignment settings page

In Moodle's debug mode, a peculiar notice appeared within the assignment settings: 'Array to string conversion in /usr/share/nginx/html/lib/pear/HTML/QuickForm/select.php on line 501'. We've made some adjustments to ensure that this doesn't appear in future.

#### You can now exit lightboxes using the 'Close' button
       	
We received a report that the Close button in the Plagiarism Plugin's lightboxes wasn't performing correctly, in that it wasn't actually closing anything! Instead, users saw the following error: 'Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'close' of undefined at HTMLAnchorElement.onclick'. Thanks for the heads up, @Haietza! We've fixed this issue.

> **Lightboxes** display content by filling the screen and dimming out the rest of the web page. They can be closed to find the website contents still available. Items such as the QuickMark manager and the rubric manager are contained inside a lightbox.

#### Instructors can now successfully submit on behalf of a student
  	
An instructor encountered an issue when attempting to resubmit on behalf of a student within a group submission. This was down to us incorrectly checking the permissions of the student, rather than the submitter. These permissions told us that the student wasn't permitted to resubmit to the assignment, but if we'd checked the instructor permissions, we'd have found that their permissions allowed this. Phew. A big thanks to @micaherne for his patch to fix this! It did the job nicely.

#### Instant Similarity Reports for up to three resubmissions

Feedback Studio allows students to view their Similarity Report results immediately! Students can now view their initial Similarity Report, then revise and resubmit their work up to three times, without having to wait 24 hours for an updated report. After three resubmissions have been made, the 24-hour report generation wait time will be restored. Instantaneous similarity results give students the formative support they need to master paraphrasing and citation conventions efficiently.

> To enable resubmissions for students, you must correctly configure the assignment settings of a new or existing Moodle Direct V2 assignment.
>
> 1. Scroll to **Turnitin plagiarism plugin settings**.
> 2. Under **Report Generation Speed**, select **Generate reports immediately (students can resubmit until due date): After 3 resubmissions, reports generate after 24 hours**.

#### Genre-specific rubrics in Feedback Studio (North America only)

Revision Assistant's genre-specific rubrics are now available in Feedback Studio for our North American users, designed with 6th - 12th graders in mind! K-12 instructors can assign new rubrics to their assignments to help their students master the art of argumentative, narrative, informative, and analytical writing. If you're actively using Revision Assistant and Feedback Studio together, you can now promote consistency in the classroom by adopting the same rubrics.

> To use a new rubric for grading, you can attach it from within the assignment settings of a new or existing assignment.

#### K-12 QuickMark sets in Feedback Studio (North America only)

QuickMarks are Turnitin's most popular feedback tool among Feedback Studio instructors! But in finding that many of our default QuickMark sets failed to address the needs of our K-12 instructors and students, we've added two new sets to the Feedback Studio collection, available to our North American users! Our new drag-and-drop (and customizable!) comments will help instructors help their students to engage in revision, save time, and more importantly, achieve learning outcomes.

When a student made a resubmission to Turnitin, their previous submission wasn't removed from the assignment inbox; this led to confusion for instructors, who weren't too sure which submission was the most up-to-date version. We've made sure that resubmissions now overwrite the existing submission.

#### Students can submit their group work without access error issues

Students have frustratingly been receiving unauthorized access errors when submitting group work, which caused some confusion. After uploading their submission and navigating to the View all submissions page, the student would witness the error. We've made a solid fix to stop this from happening!

### Release:    v2017112302

- Support for Moodle 3.4
- Fixed errors due to incorrect configuration of the plugin
- Added default activity completion settings
- Fixed an issue preventing group submission grades from updating

**Support for Moodle 3.4** - After lots of tests against the release of Moodle 3.4, we're pleased to announce that Turnitin's Plagiarism Plugin now supports it.

**Fixed errors due to incorrect configuration of the plugin** - If the Plagiarism Plugin was not configured correctly and PeerMark was simultaneously enabled, this would cause an error in the assignment inbox. We've managed to resolve this!

**Added default activity completion settings** - We've added the default activity completion setting alongside the bulk edit activity completion. Default activity completion allows you to select one or more course activities or resources and change their default settings (usually 'manual') to a setting of your choice. Thanks to @tonyjbutler for his input!

**Fixed an issue preventing group submission grades from updating** - Moodle's group submissions allow one student to submit on behalf of their group. However, we ran into a breakdown in functionality where grades failed to apply to all group participants for a submission; only the student who physically made the submission would receive a grade. Now, all students in a group can view their grade in Turnitin Feedback Studio.

### Date:		2017-August-10
### Release:	v2017081001

**Fixed a bug preventing submission after declining the EULA** - We received reports that students were unable to submit to a Moodle assignment after declining the Turnitin EULA. That definitely wasn't expected, but we've quickly fixed it. Students are now able to decline the Turnitin EULA but still submit to a Moodle assignment with Turnitin enabled.

**Fixed a bug preventing submissions from processing** - We suspect our crons might have put on a little weight this month as they were becoming stuck for a few of our users! When some users deleted a submission, this would prevent the cron from running, and consequently, submissions would fail to process.

> A cron is used to execute commands automatically at a set time or date.

### Date:		2017-July-03
### Release:	v2017070301

We now support Moodle 3.3!

- Fixed a bug affecting the Moodle 3.3 bulk completion tool (Thanks to @Syxton)
- Fixed a bug causing submissions from processing

Fixed a bug affecting the Moodle 3.3 bulk completion tool - We received a report that the Moodle 3.3 bulk completion editing feature was broken as a result of the Plagiarism Plugin being installed.

Fixed a bug causing submissions from processing - If a course was deleted before a submission was sent to Turnitin, the cron would become stuck. Submissions in the queued state would stop further submissions from being processed, revealing a database error message. We've stopped exceptions (such as a deleted course) from causing any further cron processing to fail.

**Note:** A cron is used to execute commands automatically at a set time or date.

- Check if pluginlib file exists before including it. (Thanks to @nhoobin)

**Fixed a bug preventing access to Turnitin Feedback Studio** - We discovered a bug causing the similarity score button to break in Moodle's grading platform (a basic version of the Turnitin document viewer). The bug was a jQuery issue, stemming from the release of Moodle 3.1 earlier in the year. Moodle's grading platform caused our links to function incorrectly and consequently stopped instructors from viewing a student's Similarity Report. Links and buttons now work as they should.
