Feature: Plagiarism plugin works with a Moodle Workshop
  In order to allow students to send workshop submissions to Turnitin
  As a user
  I need to create a workshop with the plugin enabled.

  Background: Set up the users, course and workshop with plugin enabled
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 1         |
    And the following users will be created if they do not already exist:
      | username    | firstname   | lastname    | email                                   |
      | instructor1 | instructor1 | instructor1 | instructor1_$account_tiibehattesting@example.com |
      | student1    | student1    | student1    | student1_$account_tiibehattesting@example.com    |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user        | course | role    |
      | student1    | C1     | student |
      | instructor1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Advanced features" in site administration
    And I set the field "Enable plagiarism plugins" to "1"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Plagiarism > Turnitin plagiarism plugin" in site administration
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Enable Turnitin              | 1 |
      | Enable Turnitin for Workshop | 1 |
    And I configure Turnitin URL
    And I configure Turnitin credentials
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Enable Diagnostic Mode | Standard |
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then the following should exist in the "plugins-control-panel" table:
      | Plugin name         |
      | plagiarism_turnitin |
    # Create Workshop.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Workshop" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Workshop name                     | Test workshop |

      | plagiarism_show_student_report    | 1             |
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I edit assessment form in workshop "Test workshop" as:"

      | id_description__idx_1_editor | Aspect2 |
      | id_description__idx_2_editor |         |

  Scenario: A submission can be queued and sent to Turnitin for a workshop
    Given I change phase in workshop "Test workshop" to "Submission phase"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I follow "Test workshop"
    And I add a submission in workshop "Test workshop" as:"
      | Title              | Submission1                                                                                                                                           |
      | Submission content |This is a workshop submission that will be submitted to Turnitin. It will be sent to Turnitin for Originality Checking and matched against any sources |
      | Attachment         |plagiarism/turnitin/tests/fixtures/testfile.txt                                                                                                        |
    Then I should see "My submission"
