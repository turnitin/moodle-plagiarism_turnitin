Feature: Plagiarism plugin works with a Moodle Assignment
  In order to allow students to send assignment submissions to Turnitin
  As a user
  I need to create an assignment with the plugin enabled and the assignment to launch successfully.

  Background: Set up the plugin
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname | category | groupmode |
      | Course 1 | C1        | 0        | 0         |
    And the following users will be created if they do not already exist:
      | username    | firstname   | lastname    | email                                   |
      | instructor1 | instructor1 | instructor1 | instructor1_$account_tiibehattesting@example.com |
      | student1    | student1    | student1    | student1_$account_tiibehattesting@example.com    |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user        | course | role    |
      | student1    | C1     | student |
      | instructor1 | C1     | editingteacher |
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Advanced features" in site administration
    And I set the field "Enable plagiarism plugins" to "1"
    And I press "Save changes"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Plagiarism > Turnitin plagiarism plugin" in site administration
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Enable Turnitin            | 1 |
      | Enable Turnitin for Assign | 1 |
    And I configure Turnitin URL
    And I configure Turnitin credentials
    And I set the following fields to these values:
      | Enable Diagnostic Mode | Standard |
    And I press "Save changes"
    Then the following should exist in the "plugins-control-panel" table:
      | Plugin name         |
      | plagiarism_turnitin |
    # Create Assignment.
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage with editing mode on
    And I add a "Assignment" to section "1" and I fill the form with:
      | Assignment name                   | Test assignment name |
      | use_turnitin                      | 1                    |
      | plagiarism_compare_student_papers | 1                    |
    Then I should see "Test assignment name"
